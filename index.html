    <h1>Reflection on Data Privacy and Cybercrime</h1>

    <div id="output" class="styled-paragraph">
        When I attended the seminar for Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign, the discussion opened my eyes on how the digital world can definitely affect the people and how to keep our personal information safe i today's generation in digital world. The technology gets better and better over time, and of course some of the scammer and hackers are getting better and better too. However, the used of technology right now is getting trickier and some old people can't keep up with the technology nowadays so we called them tech savvy. Then the campaign we have discussed in seminar, we have learnt that we have a big job in protecting our sensitive information.<br><br>

        One big thing I learned is how much personal data gets collected every day, often without us even knowing it. The speakers talked about how companies gather information from things like our social media posts and online shopping. For some of us, we feel that it is a bit creepy to think that the scammers or hackers can easily track what we are doing online so it made me really think how much i share online and how i need to be carefull next time. <br><br>
        
        The campaign in the seminar also talked about the data breaches in which are happening a lot more these days or in our generation as the days passed as the hackers is getting better and better. The stories and statistics they shared were shocking! Some people had their data stolen, which caused them a lot of problems, like identity theft and money issues. This really showed me how serious data protection is. To feel more secure, it is important to us and also for everyone to know how to keep their data safe, like using trickier passwords and not using the same password for almost all their socials and be carefull on what we share.<br><br>
        
        Another important they we have learnt on what they discussed in seminar for Data Privact Campaign that how vital is the education and awareness are key. The instructor said that knowing the risks helps us make better choices. If you think about it, it is really great that the instructor gave us pratical tips, like checking our privacy settings and being carefull with app permissions. I feel like the discussion is now stuck in my head because it really showed that protecting our date is something we all need to takle seriously<br><br>
        
        Then when I remember what I am always doing, I realized that I can definitely do better because I often forget that there is a app permissions when i really need it so I allow it anyway to use the apps with their permissions and it is great that the campaign inspired me to take action on what I am doing right now. So now my plan is to be more carefull and review my online accounts to ensure that I am not sharing too much and double check always that if my accounts are secure. <br><br>
